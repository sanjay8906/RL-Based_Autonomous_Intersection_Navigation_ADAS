## Overview

**RL-Based Autonomous Intersection Navigation ADAS** is a research-oriented autonomous driving project focused on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to autonomous vehicle decision-making and navigation in road intersection environments.

Intersections introduce complex decision-making challenges because an autonomous vehicle must simultaneously consider its own state, surrounding traffic, road geometry, navigation objectives, and potential collision risks.

This project provides a modular simulation architecture that separates:

* Sensor interfaces
* Vehicle controllers
* Simulator integration
* Environment interaction
* Utility components
* Reinforcement learning components

The architecture is designed to support experimentation with autonomous driving policies while maintaining a clear separation between individual system components.

---

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a modular autonomous driving simulation framework.
2. Model intersection navigation as a sequential decision-making problem.
3. Integrate Reinforcement Learning into autonomous vehicle navigation.
4. Provide reusable sensor and controller abstractions.
5. Integrate autonomous driving scenarios using MetaDrive.
6. Support experimentation with different navigation and control strategies.
7. Evaluate autonomous vehicle behavior using safety and performance metrics.
8. Establish a foundation for future research in autonomous driving and reinforcement learning.

---

## Intersection Navigation

Intersection navigation is a challenging autonomous-driving problem because the vehicle must make decisions in an environment containing multiple interacting agents and possible paths.

Relevant information may include:

* Ego vehicle position
* Ego vehicle velocity
* Current lane
* Road geometry
* Nearby vehicles
* Relative vehicle positions
* Distance to the intersection
* Navigation target
* Traffic conditions
* Collision risk
* Vehicle acceleration and braking state

The autonomous agent must continuously observe the environment, determine an appropriate action, execute that action, and evaluate the resulting state.

---

## Reinforcement Learning Formulation

The intersection-navigation problem can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).

```text
                         Current State
                               │

                    │      π(a | s)      │
                    └─────────┬──────────┘

                            Action

                              ▼
                    ┌────────────────────┐
                    │    Environment     │
                    └─────────┬──────────┘
                              │
                 ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                 │                         │
                 ▼                         ▼
           Next State                   Reward
```

### State

The state representation may contain information such as:

* Ego vehicle state
* Surrounding traffic state
* Lane information
* Relative distances
* Road geometry
* Navigation target
* Intersection state

### Action

The action space may contain vehicle control commands such as:

* Steering
* Acceleration
* Braking
* Velocity control

### Reward

The reward function should encourage successful navigation while penalizing unsafe or inefficient behavior.

A conceptual formulation is:

```text
Reward =
    Navigation Progress
  + Task Completion
  - Collision Risk
  - Unsafe Behavior
  - Excessive Braking
  - Unnecessary Delay
```

The exact state space, action space, RL algorithm, and reward formulation will be determined by the final implementation and experimental design.

---

## Simulation Environment

The project integrates **MetaDrive** through a dedicated adapter layer.

This separation between the simulation environment and the core ADAS architecture allows the project to evolve independently of the underlying simulator.

The adapter architecture can also provide a path toward supporting additional simulation platforms in future development.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Action execution
* RL environment compliance

---

## Evaluation

A complete autonomous intersection-navigation system should be evaluated using both safety and performance metrics.

| Metric              | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Success Rate        | Percentage of successfully completed navigation episodes |
| Collision Rate      | Frequency of collisions                                  |
| Average Reward      | Mean cumulative episode reward                           |
| Episode Duration    | Number of simulation steps or time required              |
| Navigation Progress | Progress toward the target                               |
| Travel Time         | Time required to complete the scenario                   |
| Control Smoothness  | Quality of steering, acceleration, and braking           |
| Policy Stability    | Consistency across repeated experiments                  |

Future experiments should evaluate policies across multiple scenarios, traffic configurations, and random seeds.

---

## Experimental Methodology

A robust evaluation pipeline should follow a reproducible workflow:

```text
Scenario Configuration
        │
        ▼
Environment Initialization
        │
        ▼
Policy Execution
        │
        ▼
Episode Collection
        │
        ▼
Metric Calculation
        │
        ▼
Statistical Analysis
        │
        ▼
Comparison & Visualization
```

Experiments should record:

* Environment configuration
* Random seed
* Policy configuration
* Episode statistics
* Reward values
* Collision events
* Navigation success
* Execution time

This will allow different approaches to be compared consistently.
